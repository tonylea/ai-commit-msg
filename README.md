# ai-commit-msg

Automatically generate a convention commit message using OpenAI

This little cli tool was heavily cribbed from the 2 below repos, smooshing them together like an unholy science experiment. 

- [CGX](https://github.com/jeroenouw/cgx)
- [AI Commits](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits)

## Installation

Install the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g ai-commit-msg
export OPENAI_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Run the tool:

```bash

```
